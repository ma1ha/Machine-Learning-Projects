# Plant-Disease-Detection
Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection project repository! üå±üîç

Overview
In this repository, I present the fascinating journey of using various machine learning methods to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture: plant disease detection. Inspired by the Kaggle Plant Pathology Challenge, I embarked on a mission to develop robust and accurate models capable of identifying plant diseases from images.

Dataset
The heart of this project is the Kaggle Plant Pathology Dataset, a rich collection of high-resolution images capturing various plant diseases and health conditions. Each image is accompanied by labels indicating the presence of multiple diseases, making it a challenging yet rewarding dataset to work with.

Methods Explored
Throughout this project, I explored a diverse range of machine learning methods, from traditional classifiers to cutting-edge deep learning architectures. Each method brings its unique strengths and insights into the task of plant disease classification. From d convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tranfer learning to AL methods, every approach was meticulously evaluated to uncover the most effective strategies for accurate disease detection.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis: Delve into the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of diseases, visualize image features, and understand the challenges posed by different classes.
Model Development: Witness the evolution of machine learning models as they progress from basic classifiers to sophisticated neural networks, each iteration aiming to enhance accuracy and robustness.
Evaluation Metrics: Explore the performance of each model using a variety of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive view of their effectiveness.
Visualizations: Experience the power of visualizations in understanding model predictions, analyzing feature importance, and uncovering patterns in the data.
